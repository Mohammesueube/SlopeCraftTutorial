# Principle of map pixel arts

This article will introduce how minecraft map pixel arts works, including 3D, flat and file-only maps. SlopeCraft cracks on these machanisms. By learning and hacking on these machnisms, people make custom images shown of maps.

## Why Maps ?
Minecraft map pixel arts can be divided into two types: optical arts and map arts. Optical arts are built to be seen straightforwardly, they can be horizental like floors, or vertical like walls. opticacl arts are straight and simple, but they are huge, unconvenient to apperciate. But map can be put in an item frame then multiple maps together make a larger image displayed on wall of floor. That's the benefit of map arts.

In optical arts, blocks show their original texture colors, each blocks are different. However, things changed in map arts. On map, blocks are displayed in a slightly different way, many blocks have exactly identical colors on map, for example, snow and white concrete. Besides, to most blocks,  there's a slight but noticable difference between texture colors and map colors. That makes many optical maps not shown very well in maps. Thus, the first thing is to understand the machanism of minecraft maps.
